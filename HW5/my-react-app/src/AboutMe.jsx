      <hr />
      <p>
      I am a 4th year computer engineering student at Konya Food and Agriculture University. Throughout my university life, I tried to work in areas such as web development and simple game development. I am currently strengthening my knowledge with the MEGA software course in web development, which is the area I want to focus on in the future.
